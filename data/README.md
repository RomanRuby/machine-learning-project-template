Data Organization
------------

    ├── external       <- any data we consider as being external. E.g dictionaries, constants.
    ├── processed      <- data after whole preprocessing.
    ├── raw            <- here all raw data exists. This directory should be considered as read only - just leave what we got as it is.
    └── transformed    <- intermediate format between raw and processed.
